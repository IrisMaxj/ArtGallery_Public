## Introduction
Welcome to the virtual art gallery web applicationâ€”a gateway to an immersive experience featuring over 80,000 2D artworks curated by the prestigious National Gallery of Art ([NGA](https://www.nga.gov/)). Our platform reimagines the conventional gallery visit by intertwining rich browsing capabilities with advanced data analysis tools. Users can seamlessly explore and appreciate these masterpieces from the comfort of their homes or any location, catering to both recreational and educational endeavors. The application offers a range of features, including artwork display, user-input keyword searches, selection filters, and robust data analysis functionalities. Our aspiration is to inspire individuals through this virtual journey, sparking an appreciation that may translate into physical visits to the NGA. We believe that this blended experience will enrich and elevate their perception of these extraordinary artworks.

A section of color palette is automatically generated based on each artwork for aesthetic inspirations. 4 similar artworks are recommended to users at the bottom. The algorithm utilizes the facts of shared artists/exhibition/style/theme/etc. Users can continue exploring similar artworks by a simple click.
